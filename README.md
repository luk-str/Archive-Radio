# Archive Radio

üë®‚Äçüíª _This is a work in progress_

The goal of the project is to make a simple web app that allows users to play music from selected open collections of [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

It's built in **NextJS** and written in **TypeScript**. Both of these are new to me and my intention is to explore and learn new technologies while making something fun.

**Feel free to follow along, contribute, correct my bad coding style or just grab it and make it your own üññ**

_üîó The current build of the main branch is always running live at https://archive-radio.vercel.app_

## How to get started
